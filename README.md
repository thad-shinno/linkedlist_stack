# linkedlist_stack

This only works for integers

**Linked List** is an array structure consisting of nodes. Each node has two elements: an integer value, and a next node.

**Stack** is a last-in first-out data structure.  A stack can:
- push (add a node to the top of the stack)
- pop (remove a node from the top of the stack and return its value)
- peek (return the value of the top node)
